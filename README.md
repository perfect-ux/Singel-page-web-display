# Singel-page-web-display
simple as jquery, html assingment

You are tasked with creating a responsive, 3 page web-based single page application (SPA) as per the description that follows. 

Part 1:
Create a web-application and enable jQuery for the particular page.  Refer to Fig. 1.  The site will consist of three pages, namely “Home”, “Register” and “About”.  Each page is divided into four sections: the header (marker 2), the main content or body area (marker 3), the footer (marker 4) and the whitespace behind the main content or body area (marker 5).  Note the page title (marker 1).  

Create and apply CSS structures as follow:
    • The background colours for the header, footer, main content area and whitespace for all three pages must be applied from an external style sheet, named       ExternalSheet.  The background colours for the header, main content area and footer may be any colour of your choosing, but the whitespace should stay white in colour.
    
    • The font-family for the header must be Arial and that of the footer Courier New.  The foreground colours for the header, main content area and footer must be contrasting to that of the background colours i.e. opposite the selected background colour according to the colour wheel (investigate the colour wheel and how colours are applied for effect).
    
    • The font-size for the header section should be h1 and that of the footer should be h6 in size.
    • The header text should be centred as should that of the footer.  The text of the main content area should be justified.
    
    
    
    Part 2:
Homepage (refer to fig. 2).  Create 3 menu-links in the header section of each page (marker 6).  These links should redirect the user to the three different pages (Home, Register and About).

Add 4 paragraphs to the main content area of the Homepage (marker 7).  The first paragraph should make use of a local style sheet for its formatting purposes.  The first paragraph text should read “Why You Should Vote in the 2020 Elections”, be centred and the text size should be h2 and the font-family Arial.  The foreground colour should be a contrasting colour to that of the background.

Paragraphs 2 to 4 should contain text relaying your own interpretation of why it is important to vote in the upcoming 2020 elections.  Paragraphs 2 to 4 should make use of local style sheet formatting and the text should be justified.  The font-size can be left to the default setting and the font-family for the paragraphs should be Arial.  The foreground colour should match that of paragraph 1.


Part 3:
Refer to fig. 3.  Create a paragraph for the Register page (marker 8).  The paragraph should make use of a local style sheet for its formatting purposes.  The first paragraph text should read “Please Register Here”, be centred and the text size should be h2 and the font-family Arial.  The foreground colour should be a contrasting colour to that of the background.
Next create a form (marker 9).  The following textboxes should be created:
    • Name
    • Surname
    • ID Number
    • Password
    • Confirm Password
The form should contain the following buttons:
    • Submit
    • Clear
None of the fields may be empty when the submit button is clicked.  An appropriate error message should display if a field is empty on clicking submit.
The password must be checked for length (at least 7 characters) and the password and confirm password fields should match.  The password fields should hide text with the * symbol.  There should be an appropriate error message for non-matching passwords as well as for a password that is too short.
If the clear button is clicked, all fields should be cleared.
If the user adhered to all of the above once the submit button is clicked, a message should display that the registration was successful and the About page should be loaded
